### Test Structure

The tests are written in **Playwright** and are organized into a page object model to keep the code clean and maintainable. The core files in the structure are:

- **`loan-details-page.js`**: Page Object class that encapsulates all interactions with the loan details form.
- **`loan-details.spec.js`**: Spec file containing the test cases that validate different user inputs on the loan details form.

### Test Cases

The tests are designed to verify the form submission with valid and invalid inputs for different fields.

#### 1. **Loan Amount**:
   - Verifies that an invalid loan amount triggers the appropriate error message.

#### 2. **Loan Duration**:
   - Verifies that the user can select a valid loan duration from predefined options.

#### 3. **Loan Use**:
   - Verifies that the user can select a valid loan use category (e.g., "Bills / Expenses").
