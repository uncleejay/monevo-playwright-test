### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Install Playwright browsers:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install --with-deps
    ```

4. Ensure you have Node.js installed (preferably version `lts/*`).

---

### Test Structure

The tests are written in **Playwright** and are organized into a page object model to keep the code clean and maintainable. The core files in the structure are:

- **`loan-details-page.js`**: Page Object class that encapsulates all interactions with the loan details form.
- **`loan-details.spec.js`**: Spec file containing the test cases that validate different user inputs on the loan details form.

---

### Test Cases

The tests are designed to verify the form submission with valid and invalid inputs for different fields.

#### 1. **Loan Amount**:
   - Verifies that an invalid loan amount triggers the appropriate error message.

#### 2. **Loan Duration**:
   - Verifies that the user can select a valid loan duration from predefined options.

#### 3. **Loan Use**:
   - Verifies that the user can select a valid loan use category (e.g., "Bills / Expenses").

#### 4. **Personal Title**:
   - Verifies that the user can select a valid title ("Mr.", "Mrs.").

#### 5. **Personal Name**:
   - Verifies that the user can enter a valid first and last name.

#### 6. **Date of Birth**:
   - Verifies that the user can enter a valid date of birth.

#### 7. **Email**:
   - Verifies that the user can enter a valid email and shows an error for an invalid one.

#### 8. **Phone Number**:
   - Verifies that the userâ€™s UK mobile phone number is valid, with a regex validation for format.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```

3. You can specify which test to run using the `--project` flag if you have multiple configurations. For example:
    ```bash
    npx playwright test --project=firefox
    ```

### Running Tests on CI/CD

This repository is integrated with GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on push or pull request events to the `main` or `master` branches.

The CI workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` file. The configuration:
- Installs dependencies and Playwright browsers.
- Runs tests using Playwright.
- Uploads test reports for review.

When a push or pull request is made to the `main` or `master` branch, the tests will automatically run and the results will be available in the GitHub Actions UI.

---

### Test Reports

After running the tests, the test reports are generated in the `playwright-report/` directory. This directory contains detailed reports on test execution, including screenshots, videos, and logs.

Test reports are uploaded as artifacts to GitHub Actions and are retained for 30 days.

---

### Conclusion

This project aims to provide a solid framework for testing the loan details form, ensuring that all fields behave correctly and validations work as expected. It integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing with every change.
